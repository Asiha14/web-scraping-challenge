# Web Scraping Challenge

In this assignment, we were charged with building a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. To complete the initial scraping I used Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Splinter. I then converted the Notebook to to Python code and used MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped.
